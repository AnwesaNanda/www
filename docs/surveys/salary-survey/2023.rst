   .. rubric:: Note on independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed

   In this year's survey, we asked those who filled out the survey as independent contractors, freelancers or self-employed people what term they used to describe their type of employment. Just over half (53.2%) preferred the term "contractor", another 27.8% used "self-employed", and 16.5% used "freelancer". Two respondents chose "other": the terms supplied were "agency" and "consultant".

   In this report, we'll use the term "contractors" to refer to this group.

Of those respondents who chose "Other" and provided more detail, the additional categories included project management, product management, process managment, information architecture, instructional design, QA/testing, content strategy, mentoring, and translation - as well as some terms which can be bundled under the heading "DocOps": documentation tool and workflow administration, repository maintenance, and documentation infrastructure development and support. 

Team breakdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most widely-selected team configurations were single category: 25.2% of respondents worked only on a team made up of people with the same or similar roles, while 12.7% worked only on a team made up of people with differing roles. 8.5% worked only solo, and 7.1% selected only management. These four configurations covered just over half of all respondents - the other half chose a combination of categories. 

THIS IS MESSED UP: need to cut the data a different way:
Looking at the overall ratios, 49% of respondents worked on teams of people with the same or similar roles at least part of the time, while 43.7% of respondents worked on teams with people of differing roles. 25.1% worked on multiple teams, while 26.4% worked solo some of the time and 18.8% performed the duties of a manager or team leader some of the time.

The length of time that an employee has been in their current role at their current organization can be used as a measure of how volatile the job market is - a spike in job durations of less than a year, first seen in 2021 and peaking in 2022, reflected 


In 2022, a particularly volatile job market saw the proportion of respondents who had been in their current role for less than 1 year outstrip those who had held their current job for a medium or extended duration - for the first time since the survey began. This was building on a trend that was first seen in 2021, when new position

That trend is starting to settle down in 2023 results - once again, the largest proportions are respondents who have been in the same role for a duration of 2-5 years, followed by a duration of 1-2 years.
