Benefits of Organizing a Meetup
===============================

Write the Docs community members have enhanced their careers by organizing a meetup. Beyond leadership, meetup organizers have built skills that have enhanced their careers as Technical Writers, Community Organizers, Developer Relations Engineers, and more.

In this page, several of our meetup leaders share their stories of how organizing a meetup has helped them.

Being a meetup leader has enhanced my career. It's made me a better speaker. It's helped me find resources in the open source community. It's opened career options such as Developer Relations. Besides, it's turned me into a community organizer, like the 44th US President! 

I became a Write the Docs meetup organizer after the 2014 conference. I was the only writer in my office, and I needed to connect with people with similar experiences. So before the end of the 2014 conference, I announced that I was starting a Write the Docs meetup in Portland.

Three weeks later, nearly 100 people had signed up. I told a co-worker about this over lunch, and he asked me, "So Mike, when's your first meetup?" That's when our Portland meetup really started!
