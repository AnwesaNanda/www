Livestream or record a Meetup
=============================

Livestreaming and recording Meetups are a great way to reach a distributed audience! There are many reasons to
livestream or upload recorded presentations, thank you for taking on the extra work.

YouTube permissions
-------------------

We welcome audio and video streams or uploads to the Write the Docs Podcast & Meetups YouTube channel.

Here's how WTD Meetup organizers can request access to our YouTube Studio channel:

* Request access when you fill out the *Meetup organizer contact information* form (check slack).

  Tag @rose w, the Meetup lead. Other WTD Meetup team members or staff may be able to assist.

After you have access channel, you can upload a recorded meetup or livestream.

Record a Meetup presentation
----------------------------

We recommend recording video and audio for your Meetup presentation. You are welcome to record and upload audio-only presentations to the channel as well.

Here are some best practices for recording a Meetup presentation:

* **Microphone** - an external microphone is best, an internal laptop microphone can work.
* **Camera** - an external camera is best, an internal laptop camera can work. 
* **Music/sound** - use copyright-free or original sound, otherwise YouTube will likely flag copyrighted content.

Optional: After you record the presentation or event. You can use video editing software, or live using software such as `Open Broadcast Studio (OBS) <https://obsproject.com/>`_, to mix the speaker and slides onto one recording.

Once the recording is complete, convert it to `a format YouTube supports <https://support.google.com/youtube/troubleshooter/2888402?hl=en>`_ so you can upload it.

2. Follow the appropriate instructions to upload your recorded Meetup presentation. 
   Checkout how to  `Upload videos in YouTube Studio <https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop>`_.

Stream a Meetup presentation
----------------------------

Livestreaming a meetup event is a great way to interact with remote attendees. YouTube includes a live chat for livestream attendees. It does take more effort to setup in comparison to uploading a recorded meetup presentation.

Here are some best practices for livestreaming a Meetup presentation:

* **Schedule your livestream** - scheduling your livestream allows you to add the link to your Meetup event in advance.
* **Test your livestream** - test your slides, video, audio quality, and lighting.
* **Background** - consider a virtual background for people on camera, if that's not an option you might want to tidy up the space around you.

Start your livestream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're happy with your tech setup and background, here's how you start your stream.

1. Ensure you are logged in to the correct YouTube Studio channel.
2. Click **Create** > **Go live** from the menu.
3. 

You can start a live stream by clicking the "Create > Go Live" button in the YouTube top menu. You can schedule a live stream for a future date from the same button and then set a date in the following settings screen.

Give your live stream a name, and then click "Create Stream." The next screen gives you a stream key that you need to connect to desktop (or mobile) streaming software. `Read this guide <https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en>`_ for a full list of what YouTube supports, and we stick with OBS for this guide.

In the main OBS window, click "Settings > Stream," select "YouTube/YouTube Gaming," and paste the stream key into the text field below.

Setup your audio and video inputs (which can include cameras, microphones, applications, and more) by reading `this OBS guide <https://obsproject.com/wiki/Sources-Guide>`_. It's a powerful application, and widely used, so you should be able to find lots of resources online to solve any issues you have. You can preview the stream your computer sends in the main preview window, and drag the video inputs to the locations and sizes you want. You can record and live stream at the same time by clicking both the "Start Streaming" and "Start Recording" buttons.

When you're ready, click "Start Streaming," and you're live! Click "Start Streaming" again when you're finished to stop the stream.

Use Your Personal Account
-------------------------

Another option is for you to use your personal YouTube accounts to live-stream or record. Then click the three dots next to the video title in your YouTube creator studio to download the video file and send it to us to upload to our YouTube channel.
