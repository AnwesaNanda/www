**Write the Docs Meetups** allow for documentarians to get to know their 
community better. Meetup events are a great way to stay up to date 
with the documentation world, and meet some great people in the process.

All of our meetups are organized by volunteers in their local communities.
Each Meetup has its own style as unique as the locale they represent and those
who organize it.

Meetup has updated their platform to support virtual events. organizers 
can choose to host their events in person or virtually depending
on their preferences and input from their communities.

Virtual Meetup events are a great opportunity to network with people in your
local community as well as anyone in an overlapping time zone.



We invite you to join a meetup in your local community. If your local community
isn't listed here, feel free to `start one <../organizer-guide/meetups/starting>`_
and let us know. We'd be happy to promote it and list it here.

We have several pages of meetup documentation:
