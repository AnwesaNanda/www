Writing Day update!
===================
   
Hey folks,

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ holds a special place in our heart and community.
We must confess, we have not always been the best at promoting it. In the past we have focused on the opportunities that Writing Day 
creates for our attendees. We realized that our previous method falls short, especially when it comes to reminding our friends in 
open source about the benefits of bringing their projects to Writing Day!

What better way to show you, our open source friends, our appreciation and love than listing the reasons why Writing Day is worth it!

Why bring your project to Writing Day?
--------------------------------------

Writing Day is an opportunity for you to show off your open source project. 
Bringing your open source project to Writing Day gives you the chance to:

1. Promote
2. Recruit
3. Improve

Free advertisement and the chance to onboard tech writers and potential new users, what's not to love? You get to promote your project
to a new and enthusiastic audience who wants to contribute.

The truth is that it benefits your open source projects and your communities just as much as our attendees.
This empowers all of us to work together to create opportunities for each other and bigger, better communities.
