Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey folks!

The {{city}} conference is less than two months away, and we're busy making things happen behind the scenes, and remembering how in-person conferences work again.

You've already seen our list of awesome speakers, now we can also show you the schedule so you know when they will be presenting! 

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. 

We're learning and adapting from our virtual events from the past couple of years, so we're introducing a moderated Q&A session after each speaker, with exact details of how that will work still to be confirmed.

Hiking!
-------

We're reviving the traditional Pittock Mansion `hike <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/outing/>`_ on Saturday, keep an eye on future emails for details on exactly where and when we're meeting.

Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ is happening on Sunday. It is much more fun when folks come with projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.

If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page `submit your project here <https://forms.gle/NNBzBCwjdB2vF7ZeA>`_ or drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_. You are also welcome to show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!


Shirts on sale
--------------

The `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} Pop-Up Shop <https://shirt.writethedocs.org/>`_ is open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want.

The campaign will run in batches until May 31st. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. However, due to the global shipping situation, we recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your fancy new garb during the conference.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge. And even though this years conference is held online, we're holding to that plan.

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want, this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ all day Monday and on Tuesday afternoon. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a specific thing? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Monday night we'll be hosting a quiet party somewhere, with plenty of space to chat and mingle. 

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.
