Events and Activities, Hike Update, and Livestream
==================================================

We're less than 2 weeks out from the conference, and we hope everyone is getting excited!

In this update, we're happy to share with you the different events and activities that will be available as a part of the conference,
discuss a change to the hike, and share details on the talk livestream.

Remember to check out our `Welcome Wagon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/welcome-wagon/>`_ guide and the `Visiting {{city}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/visiting/>`_ page for information around transit, food, and making the most out of the conference.

Hike Reroute
------------

Unfortunately, there is a closure of the trail that we were planning to hike because of a large rain event this spring.
This means the hike will turn into an "out and back" hike from Lower Macleay Trailhead to Pittock Mansion.
The options for public transit at the bottom of the trail are a bit limited,
so we will work to ensure folks have a ride, or can get a ride share back to your accommodation.

Live streaming
--------------

If you can't attend the conference in person, we will be broadcasting all the main stage presentations on our `livestream page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/livestream>`_ .
You can join the #live-streaming channel on Slack to connect with other remote attendees, ask questions, and troubleshoot technical issues with the stream.
We are excited to be able enable folks to participate in the conference from afar!

Events and activities
---------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge:

-  **Join us on the hike**. If you're in town early, join us on Saturday for our traditional `hike <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/outing/>`_. This activity is a great chance to get to know your fellow documentarians in a smaller setting. The hike is free with your conference ticket, but space is limited!
-  **Host a table or participate in Writing Day.** The `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/writing-day/>`__
   will be held on Sunday from *9am-5pm*, with a reception afterwards.
   You can drop in at any time during the day. If you have a project you
   want to propose to others, you can pitch your topic during the
   welcome announcement that morning.
-  **Welcome reception.** The meet-and-greet event will be held on Sunday from *5pm-7pm*. You can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks and snacks on us. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts, and beat the Monday morning rush.
-  **Plan an unconference session.** We’ll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/unconference/>`__
   all day Monday and Tuesday. Want to chat with like-minded folks about
   a very specific thing? This is the place. We’ll have a sign-up board
   so you know what’s happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
-  **Plan a lightning talk.** We’ll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/lightning-talks/>`__
   each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of
   fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to
   share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides
   are not required.
-  **Join us at the Monday night social.** This is an event just for conference attendees, held on *Monday evening from 7pm-9pm*, with free snacks and drinks. It will be held at Loyal Legion (710 SE 6th Ave).

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.

See you soon!

We're excited about the conference and can't wait to see you all in {{city}}!
