Announcing Portland conference speakers
=======================================

Our Portland conference is happening in just under 3 months, and we're excited to see everyone again in {{city}}.
Now is a great time to start booking your tickets and travel,
and we hope to see you soon.

The biggest announcement today is our speakers and talks for the conference. 
Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a proposal,
we literally wouldn't have an event without you!

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Every year, we look to bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs stage. Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics â€“ with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure.

We're really excited about the `presentations <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ we've got this year:

Head over to the `speakers page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ on our site to see the full abstracts.

We hope there's something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

Book your tickets today
-----------------------

If you don't have your ticket yet, now's a great time to start the process to attend.
Conference tickets have sold out in the past,
and tickets sell faster after with the speaker announcement,
so don't leave it to the last minute.

Please remember to book your travel only after you purchase a conference ticket. With the conference returning to in-person this year, we are working hard to make sure that our attendees have a safe and comfortable experience, so we must maintain capacity limits and guarantee late-registration tickets if you booked your travel already. 

* Read our `Convince your manager page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/convince-your-manager/>`_ to help make the case for attending.
* Buy your tickets on our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.

Opportunity Grants closing soon
-------------------------------

Applications for our Opportunity Grant program **close on March 1st**.
This program is open to anyone who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference,
and we'd love to have more folks applying.

If you're close to Portland, we'll also be announcing our Call for Volunteers in the next couple weeks.
This will get you a free ticket to the conference in return for working a couple 2-3 hour shifts at the event.

`Apply for a grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ today!

Thanks to our sponsors
----------------------
