Announcing Portland conference speakers
=======================================

Our Portland conference is happening in just under 3 months, and we're excited to see everyone again in {{city}}.
Now is a great time to start booking your tickets and travel,
and we hope to see you soon.

The biggest announcement today is our speakers and talks for the conference. 
Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a proposal;
we literally wouldn't have an event without you!

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Each year we bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs . Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics â€“ with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure.

We're really excited about the `presentations <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ we've got this year:

We hope there's something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

Buy your tickets soon
---------------------

If you don't have your ticket yet, now's a great time to start the process to attend.
Conference tickets have sold out in the past,
and tickets sell faster after the speaker announcement,
so don't leave it to the last minute.

Please remember to book your travel only after you purchase a conference ticket.
With the conference returning to in-person this year, we are working hard to make sure that our attendees have a safe and comfortable experience.
This means we have capacity limits and can't guarantee late-registration tickets if you book travel without a conference ticket. 

* Read our `Convince your manager page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/convince-your-manager/>`_ to help make the case for attending.
* Buy your tickets on our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.

Call for Volunteers
-------------------

We're also looking for volunteers to help out at the conference.
Generally volunteers live within driving distance to the venue,
or are just excited about helping out with the conference.
Volunteering will get you a free ticket to the conference in return for working at least two shifts (averaging around 3 hours each) at the event.

This form will stay open until we have enough volunteers signed up for the event.
The earliest we plan to close the form would be March 15.
Volunteers will receive additional information in early April regarding shifts, detailed duties, and other updates to the volunteer duties and schedules.

* `Complete our volunteer application form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbnCr0Kbay2mBTe0mM7lTP85tzj9DUFD8LCyegUugk81KQGg/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_ if you're interested in volunteering.

Opportunity Grants close on March 1
-----------------------------------

Applications for our Opportunity Grant program **close on March 1st**.
This program is open to anyone who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference,
and we'd love to have more folks applying.

* `Apply for a grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ before the deadline.

Thanks to our sponsors
----------------------
