Announcing the Call for Proposals
=======================================

We're excited to announce our Portland `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_, starting earlier than last year, as the conference is also a little earlier in the year.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We're looking for talk proposals to be delivered in-person, on-stage in Portland.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} PST**.

(If you'd prefer not to attend an in-person event due to COVID-19 or any other reason, keep an eye out for `Atlantic_news`_ held online in a timezone as widely accessible as possible).

.. _Atlantic_news_2024:

Write the Docs Atlantic, online date TBD
----------------------------------------

If you want to speak at Write the Docs, but can't or don't want to attend an in-person event, keep an eye out for Write the Docs Atlantic, an online conference coming later in 2024.

This conference will be entirely virtual, in a timezone that works for as many people as possible, so you can present or attend from anywhere.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale early **2023**.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford the tickets and still wish to attend, we will launch our grants program soon after opening ticket sales.
