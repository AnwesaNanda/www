Sponsorship Prospectus
######################

Introduction
============

Welcome to the Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} sponsorship prospectus.
We're excited to work with the organizations in our community to build the best documentation event in {{ year }}.
Created in 2013 in Portland, Oregon, WTD has hosted conferences around the world in Prague, Berlin, Sydney, London, and Melbourne.
We’re excited to celebrate year 12 with your support!

We expanded the offerings and introduced a lot of new things,
but please let us know if there are other points of interaction with our community that would be valuable for you.

Concept
=======

Write the Docs (https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a
**three day conference** held on {{ about.date }} focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as "documentarians".

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

Demographics
============

Our audience is primarily from companies in the software industry.

Each conference we sell:

* 70% Corporate tickets
* 20% Independent tickets
* 10% Student tickets

For those people, they have a range of job titles.
The most common job title is **Technical Writer**,
but we have many other people who attend our conferences:

- Technical Writers (60%)
- Developers (10%)
- Support Staff (10%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

We work hard to keep ticket prices affordable for a broad range of attendees.
Your sponsorship makes it possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events,
whether they're a freelancer, a student or out of work.
Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your commitment to and support of good documentation,
and the people who build it.
