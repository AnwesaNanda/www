  SUBJECT: Docs hackathon: Documentation Community Conference

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs {{city}}, which takes place {{ date.main }}. This three-day event explores the art and science of documentation, and covers a diverse range of topics related to documentation in the software industry. I am particularly interested in Writing Day, I believe this event can positively impact our project and community.
  
  Writing Day is a community event modeled after the concept of “code sprints” or “hackathons”, which are common in open-source conferences. The idea is to get a bunch of people together and have them work towards a shared goal, in this case the goal is creating or improving documentation or other related projects.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket - {{tickets.corporate.price}}

  Writing Day Benefits:

  * Introduce our project and community to a new audience and demographic in our industry
  * Get highlighted as a project in the conference blog and announcements - submit online by March 28, 2024
  * Onboard documentation enthusiasts to increase the likelihood of post-conference contributions
  * Strategically tackle documentation tickets and requests
  * Update existing documentation
  * Peer review new and exisiting documentation

  Conference Benefits:

  * Exposure to the latest ideas, techniques, and tools for software docs
  * Opportunity to learn from the best doc teams in the industry
  * Building professional connections with other documentarians

Bringing our project to Writing Day benefits us as a community. It gives us the opportunity to increases our documentation standards and practices and create a more inclusive project.

  Thanks in advance,
  [your name]

When discussing how to pitch Writing Day, a few generally helpful tips emerged:

* Highlight a few specific projects that attended previous Writing Days. 
* If your community is looking for regularly documentation contributions, Writing Day is a great place to onboard potential contributors to onboard documentarians, 
* Don't forget that one of the benefits to your attendance is that it raises the visibility of your community and/or company in the Write the Docs community. If your project wants a reputation for caring about their docs, having people at Write the Docs is a great way to do that.

In addition, it can be useful to share some info about previous conferences. View the `main page overview </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/#schedule-overview>`_ explaining what is Write the Docs, history and schedule overview.
