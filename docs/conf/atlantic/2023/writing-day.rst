The Good Docs Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`The Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/>`_ is an open source community of 60+ technical writers, doc tools 
experts, UX designers, and software engineers who are committed to improving the quality 
of documentation in open source. We aim to educate and empower people to create 
high-quality documentation by providing them with templates, resources, best practices, 
and tools to enhance their documentation in open source and beyond.

Our project is divided into small working groups that consist of a few people collaborating 
together to work on a Good Docs Project initiative or focus area of the project. Throughout 
Writing Day, weâ€™ll feature workshops that will introduce you to our project and provide 
feedback on these key initiatives, such as our project to provide templates for a variety 
of documentation content.
