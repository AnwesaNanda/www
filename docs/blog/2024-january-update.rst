Write the Docs Community Update - January 2024
===============================================

Hey folks, Eric Holscher here, one of the co-founders of Write the Docs.
I'm here with our traditional January community update to give the newsletter team the month off.

2024 is looking to be a refinement of our approach to 2023,
with a few new experiments thrown in.

Our 2024 conferences
--------------------

It was lovely to see everyone again in Portland & Australia conferences this year,
and to continue connecting virtually with our Atlantic conference.
We're planning for 2024 to be similar to last year:

* `Portland <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/>`_ will be in-person on **April 14-16**.
* `Atlantic <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2024/>`_ will be a virtual event, spanning the US and European timezones, on **September 22-24**.
* Australia will likely be in-person again in December, but we're still working on the details.

We are currently accepting `talk proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/cfp/>`_ and selling tickets for our Portland conference.
**Submit your talk proposals by January 15th**.

We hope that you'll work with us to make all of our events unique again this year by submitting talks and showing up in-person or virtually.

Community board and teams
-------------------------

We've had our Community Board & CoreOps team in place for a year now,
and we've been posting `quarterly updates <https://www.writethedocs.com/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_ for everyone to read.
We continue to refine our processes and approach,
and would love any feedback that folks have.

Overall, we're pretty happy with the structure that we have in place,
and are looking forward to continuing to refine it in 2024.

Salary Survey
-------------

We just finished up the 2023 Salary Survey, and we're excited that we had **over 1,000** responses.
There were enough contractors this year for us to break out some high-level data,
along with our normal breakdown of full-time employees.

We plan to release the results in Q2 of the year,
and will be sure to share that in the newsletter.
There was also talk about possibly doing a tooling survey this year,
and that is something we are considering as an additional service to the community.
We aren't 100% sure what that will look like,
so if you have any good examples or ideas, please let us know!

Other community updates
-----------------------

We have shared our high-level community stats for past 6 years,
and will continue to do it each year going forward.
