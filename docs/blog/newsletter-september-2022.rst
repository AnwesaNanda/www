Write the Docs Newsletter – September 2022
##########################################

Hey, everyone, the newsletter is back! We took one of our regularly scheduled breaks, but now we're back with regularly exceptional insights from our community.

If you'd like to get more of those insights, it's your last chance to get `tickets for the Prague conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2022/tickets/>`__. Ticket sales end on September 8. Then the conference starts September 11. We'll certainly all have lots of new ideas to think about afterwards.

And if you have insights of your own to share, there's still (a little) time to sign up to present at the Australia conference. For more details, see the `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2022/cfp/>`__. The deadline for submissions is September 16. And you can join the conference to see all the amazing ideas on December 8--9.

And we still have the excellent insights from the past couple of months to share with you here. A reminder that if you see a conversation in Slack that seems relevant for the newsletter, tag it with the ``:suggest-for-newsletter:`` emoji. We'll summarize the most interesting topics here (almost) every month.

--------------------------------
Collecting helpful user feedback
--------------------------------

Getting helpful user feedback is an eternal concern for documentarians. Is there a collection method that both encourages user participation and delivers categorizable data about docs quality and effectiveness? Open comment fields give users space to expand and offer details, but lengthy comments can be difficult to categorize for higher-level analysis.

One-click ratings mechanisms with limited options offer a low obstacle for users---think thumbs up/thumbs down icons or a range of smiley faces like `HappyOrNot <https://www.happy-or-not.com/en/solution/>`__. The limited options are helpful for finding patterns in feedback and some documentation platforms even have such ratings tools built it. The drawback is that ratings scales often don't include a way for users to provide details, so you don't get any information about the reasons behind the user ratings. If you choose to collect ratings, take care to offer only a few options to keep the feedback meaningful.

Some have had good results with prefilled feedback options as a middle ground between open-ended text fields and limited one-click rating scales. For example, you might ask users to complete a sentence from a list of short answers, such as completing "This page is..." with options like "helpful," "incomplete," "confusing," or "too long." The prefilled answers provide more detailed information that's still categorizable without burdening users. If desired, you can include options for sending detailed feedback or even creating tasks for doc team review.

Improving communication about what's in releases
------------------------------------------------

We recently had a discussion about how to keep communication in sync between engineering, product managers (PMs), and documentation. In particular, about making sure that tech writers know if the product is changing so they know what needs doing for a release.

The original poster hadn't had much success asking engineering to keep them informed -- often engineering would forget. So they were thinking of trying to improve this with better process, via PMs; surely PMs keep tabs on what's changing in the product and are aware of what changes might need doc work?

The answer is, it depends, because how PMs work with engineering can vary hugely among organizations and even among teams. Some PMs are the main point of contact for what's changing, and want to be kept in the loop. Oothers are focused on handling user requests and reviewing feature designs and aren't really involved in launching and so engineering is a better source.

Several contributors agreed that simply working more closely was the answer. Many tech writers get involved in longer-term planning meetings or even join in sprint meetings; this helps with understanding what's coming up without introducing new processes or extra effort for other roles.

A lot of it does come down to building relationships. You can institute a process that's meant to keep tech writing informed -- but ignoring a checkbox isn't so hard for your colleagues. Whereas if they know you, talk to you regularly, and understand the value your work brings, they're much more likely to provide you with the information you need.

-------------------------------------
Is coding necessary for tech writing?
-------------------------------------

Is coding required for technical writing? Many individuals interested in the field have asked this question. Even seasoned tech writers ask and are unable to get a definite answer.

In short, no. To be a tech writer, you don’t need to code. However, the skill is valuable and may make you more employable. Knowing how to interpret code can also be useful if you come across API documentation or need to edit code comments at work.

If you think learning how to code will better your career prospects or help you stand out at work, websites such as `freeCodeCamp <https://www.freecodecamp.org/>`__ can help you learn languages like JavaScript and Python. If coding seems out of reach, try learning fundamental computer science concepts and how development teams work within an organization. You may find it easier to communicate with engineers with just an understanding of the basics.

Ultimately, while coding isn’t necessary for the job, many tech writers can benefit from some experience to make writing about software simpler. But keep in mind that, whether or not you decide to code, tech writing requires more skills than simply writing, so specializing in a niche can help you in the long run.
