Slack Network Sponsorship
=========================

Write the Docs is a community focused on all things related to software documentation.
Our :doc:`Slack network </slack>` is the beating heart of our community,
where thousands of documentarians hang out regularly to chat.
Sponsorship of our Slack network does two things:

* It allows us to cover the cost of moderating and managing our Slack community
* It allows you to get your name and message in front of our audience of :doc:`/documentarians`

You can join our Slack and read some of the messages to get a feel for the community.

Audience
--------

Our audience is made up of technical writers and decision makers in the software documentation industry.
The current Slack stats are:

* Over 17,000 users
* 100+ channels

We don't have specific demographic data for our newsletter,
but our conferences are made up of:

- Technical Writers (60%)
- Developers (10%)
- Support Staff (10%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)


Sponsored entry format
----------------------

Sponsor copy will be posted to the ``#announcements`` channel in Slack,
which is joined by every user in our Slack.
It's used for community-wide announcements,
so your message will be very visible in the community.

The current format is:

* Up to 300 characters of copy
* Up to 2 links in that copy
  - These links will be auto-expanded into a rich embed in Slack.

We're still experimenting with exact format details,
so let us know if you have any questions.

Schedule
--------

We currently allow 1 sponsored post per month on our Slack.
We aim to send these during the first week of the month,
but can be flexible if we haven't sold our current month.

Pricing
-------

The price for reaching our audience is **$350** per month.
