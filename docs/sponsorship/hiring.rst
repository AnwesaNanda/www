Hiring Sponsorship
==================

We have added a new sponsorship opportunity for companies looking to hire documentarians.
This sponsorship level includes: 

* A job posting in our monthly newsletter jobs section (Over {{ newsletter_subs }} subscribers)
* A highlighted job posting in our ``#job-posts-only`` Slack channel ({{ slack_members }} members)

Sponsored entry format
----------------------

The main goal here is to provide the company information, and a link to the job posting.
The format is:

* Company name
* Job title
* Job Location / Remote
* Salary (optional)
* Link to job posting

This will be used to create a newsletter entry, and a Slack post.

Schedule
--------

We publish the newsletter once a month, typically in the first week of the month.
The Slack post will be made within 1 week of the sponsorship being purchased.

Pricing
-------

The price for our hiring sponsorship is **$250** per job posting.
